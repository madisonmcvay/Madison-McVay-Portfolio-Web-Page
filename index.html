    <h2>Hello! I'm Madison McVay.</h2>

    <p class="intro-statement">I am a software developer living in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

    <p class="interests">As a health enthusiast, I am interested in:

    <ul class="interests-list">
      <li>Hiking with my wife, or anything outdoors.</li>
      <li>Training Brazilian Jiujitsu.</li>
      <li>The occasional half marathon because I am not 100% insane.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class=about-me>I have been a personal trainer for six years, working with people of all ages and backgrounds.
        While health will forever be a passion of mine, I could not overlook my fascination with the technical and
        business side. As a student at Thinkful, I look forward to the leap into software development, and cannot wait
        to
        see all the new opportunity that awaits. I hope to one day coalesce my passions together to provide health apps,
        websites, and softwares to personal trainers or health coaches looking to expand their business. </p>
